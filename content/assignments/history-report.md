## Overview
Write a short report on an assigned topic related to the history of immersive media. Topics will be assigned during class from the list below. Your report must fit on a single 8 ½ x 11” piece of paper and roughly fit into the template on the following page. You must include at least one image, and attribution for all image and information sources.
Report

While there is no minimum word count, you report should include the following:
-	When?  Relevant dates (start/end, creation, first publication, etc; as precise as available or up to the month.)
-	Who? Name the significant individuals or companies involved.
-	What? Describe the topic in enough detail to give an informed reader (your peers) a solid understanding of what the thing was.
-	Why?  Inform the reader why this thing is interesting in the context of immersive media history.
-	Your personal thoughts, opinions, and curiosities on the topic.

The report should be about 2 paragraphs. Of these, the when/who/what should be straightforward – these are objective. This will be your first paragraph. The 2nd will be the subjective: The why we care, and your own opinion about the topic.

## Image(s)
The topics will be printed out and arranged along a timeline. You must include at least one image of the topic and are free to include more as you deem appropriate. The images should help clarify the points you are making in your report.

## Attribution
Almost all assignments for IMM103 will likely require attribution, so take this opportunity to be sure to learn a workflow for tracking your research notes as you work. I do not enforce a particular style of formatting – you can use what you are used to - so long as it meets certain minimum requirements that are laid out in the syllabus. If you are wondering if you need attribution for something, then you do. This includes any quotes, information sources, and images.

## Purpose
- Engage in professional writing
- Engage with a history topic

## Submission
