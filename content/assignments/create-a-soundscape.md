title: Create A Soundscape
layout: Assignment
order: 5
---
A Soundscape is an 'acoustic environment'. It's one or more sounds that
forms a perceived environment. In digital media and media production, we
don't often create soundscapes as an explicit end-goal, but use them
with and around other elements. Like establishing setting or mood in a
podcast, supporting a setting in a film, or helping construct the
atmosphere and emotion of a video game level.

Choose an image -- photograph, illustration, painting, whatever. You can
pick anything except a screenshot of a movie or TV show, because
somebody already made a soundscape for that.

Source audio from **at least four** sources. Assemble and edit them into
one audio file that when listened to, gives you some sense of the image
as a location or setting.

Goodnight getting into audio localization or directionality too much.
It\'s not about selling space with this sound for this project but
picking audio files and editing them so they go together to help tell a
story. Or just the establishing shot to a story. Start by picking or
imagining a location, and then brainstorming all of the sounds that you
might find there. This location could be a real-life location drawn from
your memories or something completely fantastical, imaginary, or
invented. If it helps, you can think of this as doing sound design work
for a movie ... we just don\'t have the movie.

Submit your exported audio file, image, and a document with all
attribution and a few sentences for some context about what you were
aiming for.
